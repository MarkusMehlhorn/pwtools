0.2.0
-----
Most important:
- Moved examples to README.
- File renames:
    *c*   -> *vacf*
    *fft* -> *pdos*
- Output PDOS which is normalized (integral area).
- Implemented Direct Method (there is no official name) as alternative to
  FFT(vacf) for calculating the PDOS.
- Renamed option -t -> -f
- new option: -t for choosing the DOS calculation method.

other:
- Moved cmd line args parsing code out of main() to __main__ 
  on module level.
