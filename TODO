pydos.py
--------
- unify vacf_pdos(), direct_pdos(), thay have almost the same signature and
  functionallity, use a kwarg 'method' to select the method of calculation

- PDOS normalization. ATM we normalize so that Int(faxis, pdos) = area = 1.0. 
  But there may be others, like area = 3*natoms in the unit cell (not
  supercell), ...

- We assume that the ATOMIC_POSITIONS unit (crystal, alat, angstrom) in
  pw.in and that of the parsed out ones from pw.out are the same. Check this!
  For example, it is seems to be NOT the same for cp.x!

- Implement the maximum entropy method .. or not.

all
---
- Drop verbose.py. Use the logging or warnings module.

- Pythonic test suite (nose etc) instead of test/test_*.py . Most of these
  tests are actually examples. Move them to a dir examples/.

- Remove plt.show() from test_*.py . Instead, save figures to /tmp/pwtools_test
  if we really need to plot stuff.

- Fix importing. Use full module name "pwtools.foo" instead of "foo" for
  intra-package imports.
