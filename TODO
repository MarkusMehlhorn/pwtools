pydos.py
--------
- unify vacf_pdos(), direct_pdos(), thay have almost the same signature and
  functionallity, use a kwarg 'method' to select the method of calculation

- PDOS normalization. ATM we normalize so that Int(faxis, pdos) = area = 1.0. 
  But there may be others, like area = 3*natoms in the unit cell (not
  supercell), ...

- We assume that the ATOMIC_POSITIONS unit (crystal, alat, angstrom) in
  pw.in and that of the parsed out ones from pw.out are the same. Check this!
  For example, it is seems to be NOT the same for cp.x!

all
---
- Drop verbose.py. Use the logging or warnings module.

- Fix importing. Use full module name "pwtools.foo" instead of "foo" for
  intra-package imports. 

- Add class Structure to hold stuff like
    - coords
    - cp       
    - forces 
    - symbols
    - ...
    - align (attr) describing `cp` 
  much like ASE's Atoms class. This would drastically simplify the writing and
  maintaining of all functions which take coords, cp, symbols .. as args
  (crys.py). Make parsing classes have an attr `structure`, which is an
  instance of Structure.

tests
-----
- Handle known fails with nose.

- For all parsing funcs, add test output data (e.g. text files with arrays).
  np.loadtxt() these arrays and compare them to parsed ones, e.g. p.coords .

- Add tests for 
    eos.py
    crys.scell()

- crys.scell(): make symbols an optional kwarg
