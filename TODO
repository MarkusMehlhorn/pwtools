pydos.py
--------
- unify vacf_pdos(), direct_pdos(), thay have almost the same signature and
  functionallity, use a kwarg 'method' to select the method of calculation

- PDOS normalization. ATM we normalize so that Int(faxis, pdos) = area = 1.0. 
  But there may be others, like area = 3*natoms in the unit cell (not
  supercell), ...

- We assume that the ATOMIC_POSITIONS unit (crystal, alat, angstrom) in
  pw.in and that of the parsed out ones from pw.out are the same. Check this!
  For example, it is seems to be NOT the same for cp.x!

all
---
- Drop verbose.py. Use the logging or warnings module.

- io.write_*(): by using cryst_const instead of `cp`, we would get rid of the
  annoying `align` kwarg. I guess that it is not even necessary everywhere.

- Function to convert between ASE Atoms objects and things like PwOutputFile.
  We have an example script so far ...

- Using raw 3d arrays for trajectories is cumbersome, esp. when we want to do
  coord transformations (see io.write_axsf()). Add unified storage class
  Trajectory (like structure.Structure) to hide the data storage as 3d arrays.
  Make them have list-like hehavior (modify __getitem__).

  >>> traj = Trajectory(...)
  >>> assert (traj[0] == traj.raw_coords[...,0]).all()

ase interface
-------------
- Add class Structure to hold stuff like
    - coords
    - cell
    - forces 
    - symbols
    - ...
    - align (attr) describing `cp` 
  much like ASE's Atoms class. This would drastically simplify the writing and
  maintaining of all functions which take coords, cp, symbols .. as args
  (crys.py). Make parsing classes have an attr `structure`, which is an
  instance of Structure. 
  This is in progress ... see structure.py

- Subclass ase.Atoms -> PwAtoms, add set_forces() method. In
  StructureFileParser, add method get_ase_atoms() which adds forces and returns
  a PwAtoms instance. 

- Check if a ASE trajectory (do they just have this PickleTrajectory thing?) is
  just a list of Atoms objects or if PickleTrajectory instances have a list API
  while storing coords, cell etc more efficiently (like PwOutputFile as 3d
  arrays :). Then, add get_ase_traj() to PwOutputFile etc.

tests
-----
- Handle known fails with nose.

- For all parsing funcs, add test output data (e.g. text files with arrays).
  np.loadtxt() these arrays and compare them to parsed ones, e.g. p.coords .
  ... this is too much work and will never happen. Check your results when
  using this.

eos.py
------
- Use new common.Spline
