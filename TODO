pydos.py
--------
- unify vacf_pdos(), direct_pdos(), thay have almost the same signature and
  functionallity, use a kwarg 'method' to select the method of calculation

- PDOS normalization. ATM we normalize so that Int(faxis, pdos) = area = 1.0. 
  But there may be others, like area = 3*natoms in the unit cell (not
  supercell), ...

- We assume that the ATOMIC_POSITIONS unit (crystal, alat, angstrom) in
  pw.in and that of the parsed out ones from pw.out are the same. Check this!
  For example, it is seems to be NOT the same for cp.x!

- PDOS: ckeck if the frequency axis is correct. Currently we use f and not
  2*pi*f.

- Do something with the hardcoded time axis (axis=1) in all 3d arrays
  from pw.out files.

- Implement the maximum entropy method .. or not.

---
- Drop verbose.py. Use the logging or warnings module.
- Pythonic test suite (nose etc) instead of test/test_*.py . Most of these
  tests are actually examples. Move them to a dir examples/.
