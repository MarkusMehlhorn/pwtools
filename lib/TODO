pydos.py
--------
- Remove cmd line stuff. Make some test/* files to show how to calc a PDOS in
  various ways using parse.py and pydos.py as toolkits.

- unify vacf_pdos(), direct_pdos(), thay have almost the same signature and
  functionallity, use 'method' kwarg or so, OR make a base class Pdos, derive 2
  special-case classes ... 

- Implement the maximum entropy method.

- We assume that the ATOMIC_POSITIONS unit (crystal, alat, angstrom) in
  pw.in and that of the parsed out ones from pw.out are the same. Check this!
  For example, it is seems to be NOT the same for cp.x!

- PDOS normalization. ATM we normalize so that int(faxis, pdos) = area = 1.0. 
  But there may be others, like area = 3*natoms in the unit cell (not
  supercell), ...

- PDOS: ckeck if the frequency axis is correct. Currently we use f and not
  2*pi*f.

- Do something with the hardcoded time axis (axis=1) in all 3d arrays parsed
  from pw.out files.

- Test PDOS calculation with different ATOMIC_POSITIONS units for the same
  structure etc. Do they yield the same PDOS .. i.e. is the PDOS invariant
  under variation of the coordinate system or coord axis scale?

parse.py
--------
fix get_kpoints if "K_POINTS gamma"

README
------
- Remove cmd line stuff

all
---
- Drop verbose.py. Use the logging or warnings module.
- Pythonic test suite (nose etc) instead of test/test_*.py . Most of these
  tests are actually examples. Move them to a dir examples/.
