* A Trajectory returned by a slice operation cannot be iterated over b/c it
  has no attrs_nstep attribute b/c that is set in set_all()  which we don't
  call in __getitem__ b/c of speed. A similar problem with copy() was fixed in 
  rev eeb11ba0b108 by calling set_all() in copy(). Cannot do that in
  __getitem__

  The workaround is to copy the traj, i.e. smth like ``tr[10:100:2].copy()`` 
  will work.
