Example session for using pwtools.batch. The example is self-contained. Just
run it and inspect the created files. Only the files in calc.templ/ and
the potential file AlN.tersoff are needed.

The example calculations are very small and should run only some seconds.

Run the example, clean the directory (clean.sh).

The work flow would be:

1) 10input.py 

2) run calculations
    local:
        * go to calc_local
        * execute run.sh -> submitt all jobs
    cluster:      
        * copy calc_theo to the cluster
            rsync -auvz calc_theo theo:path/to/calculation/
        * ssh to cluster, go to path/to/calculation/calc_theo
        * execute run.sh -> submitt all jobs
        * copy calc_theo back from cluster
            rsync -auvz theo:path/to/calculation/calc_theo ./

3) 20parse.py

4) 30gather.py

5) 40eval.sh, 50eval.py
