To run the tests, use ./runtests.sh . Note the comments in that file.

The file files/pw.md.out.gz comes from a long MD run with nstep=1200. To lower
the file size, it has been truncated after 120 steps and the variable
control:nstep in pw.md.in has been set to 120 as well.

If all tests pass, good. If they do and the logfile does not contain warnings
but only some KNOWNFAIL statements .. very good.
