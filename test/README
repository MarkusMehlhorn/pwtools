To run the tests, use ./run_all.sh . Note the comments in that file.

The file files/pw.md.out.gz comes from a long MD run with nstep=1200. To lower
the file size, it has been truncated after 120 steps and the variable
control:nstep in pw.md.in has been set to 120 as well.
Note that you may get warnings "nstep from infile (files/pw.md.in) and outfile
(files/pw.md.out) don't match". This can be ignored. The reason is that even
though the MD itself has 120 steps, pw.x performs a first SCF run before the
MD, so that actually we have 121 steps, with step 1 beeing the start structure.
