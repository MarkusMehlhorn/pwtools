This dir contains the documentation rst source files. To build the html doc,
do::

    make html
    firefox build/html/index.html 

For this to work, you need Sphinx, the Python documention generation tool
(Debian: ``apt-get install python-sphinx``). If you don't have that, you can
simply read the ``source/written/*.rst`` files :)

By default (i.e. unpacked tarball or checked out source from bitbucket), this
will build the hand-written documentation (like the tutorial and install notes)
located in ``source/written/``.

If you like to generate the optional API doc source ``*.rst`` files
automagically before ``make html``, you need ``sphinx-autodoc.py`` [1]_ which
is used as in ``generate-apidoc.sh`` to generate ``source/generated/*``. You
also need numpydoc. Then:: 
    
    apt-get install python-numpydoc
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/elcorto/sphinx-autodoc
    ./generate-apidoc.sh
    make html
    firefox build/html/index.html 

``generate-apidoc.sh`` will use the checked out ``sphinx-autodoc.py``.
Then, ``make html`` will run longer and produce many more warnings :)
You may also want to check sphinx-autodoc's README file for more information.
