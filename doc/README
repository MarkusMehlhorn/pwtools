This dir contains the documentation rst source files. To build the html doc,
do::

    make html
    firefox build/html/index.html 

For this to work, you need Sphinx, the Python documention generation tool. If
you don't have that, you can simply read the ``source/written/*.rst`` files :)

To generate the API doc source automagically, you need ``sphinx-autodoc.py``
[1]_ which is used as in ``generate-apidoc.sh`` to generate
``source/generated/*``. But this is optional. The html doc build from the
hand-written doc files in ``source/written/`` is not affected by this. But if
you have it, then::
    
    ./generate-apidoc.sh
    make html
    firefox build/html/index.html
