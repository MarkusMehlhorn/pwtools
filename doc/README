This dir contains the documentation rst source files. To build the html doc,
do::

    make html
    firefox build/html/index.html 

For this to work, you need Sphinx, the Python documention generation tool. If
you don't have that, you can simply read the ``source/written/*.rst`` files :)

.. vim:syn=rst
